# Image to PDF Converter

## Introduction
This project is a simple Python script that converts a series of image files into a single PDF file. The motivation behind this project was to create a free and easy-to-use tool for converting images to PDFs without relying on online tools that often require a subscription or payment. Additionally, it was a fun project undertaken out of boredom and the desire to learn more about Python programming.

## Features
- Converts multiple image files (JPEG or JPG) into a single PDF.
- Automatically adjusts the page size to fit the images without cropping or rotating.
- Removes the need for online image to PDF converters.
- Provides a free and convenient way to create PDFs from images.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- Pillow (PIL) library for image manipulation (can be installed via `pip install pillow`).
- img2pdf library for PDF conversion (can be installed via `pip install img2pdf`).

## How to Use
1. Place the script in the directory containing the image files you want to convert.
2. Run the script using Python 3.
3. The script will automatically detect and convert all JPEG and JPG images in the folder.
4. The resulting PDF will be named after the folder containing the images.

## Example Usage
